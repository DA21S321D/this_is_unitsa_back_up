This repository contains the code for the paper "UniTSA: A Universal Reinforcement Learning Framework for V2X Traffic Signal Control".

## üéâ News

1. Congratulations! Our research has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology. [Read the paper here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10535743/).
2. We have transitioned the simulation platform in the project from Aiolos to [TransSimHub](https://github.com/Traffic-Alpha/TransSimHub) (TSHub). We extend our gratitude to our colleagues at SenseTime, **@KanYuheng (ÈòöÂÆáË°°)**, **@MaZian (È©¨Â≠êÂÆâ)**, and **@XuChengcheng (ÂæêÊâøÊàê)** (listed alphabetically) for their contributions. The development of TransSimHub (TSHub) is built upon the foundation of Aiolos.
3. The weights of the model have been uploaded. The uploaded model weights can be found in [save_models](./save_models) and can be verified using `eval_model.py`.

## üîë Key Points

- **Universal Model for Different Intersections**: UniTSA uses a junction matrix to characterize different intersections, enabling the same model to be applied to various intersection designs.

- **Performance Enhancement at Unseen Intersections**: UniTSA incorporates traffic state augmentation techniques that emphasize the relative positioning of vehicles, enhancing the model's adaptability to changing traffic conditions and unfamiliar scenarios.

- **Improved Results at Key Intersections**: UniTSA integrates the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, allowing for efficient model customization to specific intersections with minimal additional training.

## üì• Installation

Before using, make sure [TSHub](https://github.com/Traffic-Alpha/TransSimHub/tree/main) is installed.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Traffic-Alpha/TransSimHub.git
cd TransSimHub
pip install -e ".[rl]"
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Training

After installation, run `train_UniTSA.py` to train the model.

```shell
python train_UniTSA.py
```

The trained reward curve is roughly as follows:

<div align=center>

</div>

Note: There are large fluctuations here because the rewards vary greatly in different environments. You can rollout in advance to get the mean and variance for normalization.

The trained model will be stored in the [save_models](./save_models) directory. This model can be applied to intersections of varying structures. **For improved results under diverse traffic flow patterns, we recommend generating a wider variety of routes for training.** Please note that currently, only a subset of `rou` files have been uploaded.

## üß™ Testing

Testing can be done later. If you want to test directly on the road network in this article, you can run:

```shell
python eval_model.py
```

If you want to replace it with your own road network, you can put the road network in [sumo_datasets](./sumo_datasets/), and then modify [EVAL_CONFIG](./sumo_datasets/EVAL_CONFIG.py) to modify the corresponding road network. 

For example, you can modify the `EVAL_CONFIG` as follows:

```python
EVAL_SUMO_CONFIG = dict(
    # Four-way intersection, lane count (3,3,3,3)
    test_four_34=dict(
        tls_id = 'J1',
        sumocfg = 'test_four_34.sumocfg',
        nets = ['4phases.net.xml'],
        routes = ['0.rou.xml', '1.rou.xml',],
        start_time = 0,
        edges = ['E0', '-E1', '-E3'],
        connections = {
            'WE-EW':['E0 E1', '-E1 -E0'],
            'NS-SN':['-E3 E2', '-E2 E3']
        }
    ),
)
```

Here:

- `test_four_34`: Modify this to the name of your new folder.
- `sumocfg`: This is the path to the sumocfg file, which needs to be in the `env` directory.
- `nets`: This is the name of the SUMO net file. There can be multiple files.
- `routes`: This is the file name of SUMO routes, which needs to be in the `routes` directory. There can be multiple files.
